- Offer their expertise and experience to guide students.
- Help students navigate challenges and develop their skills.
- Provide regular feedback and constructive criticism.
- Encourage students to take ownership of their learning and growth.
- Create a supportive and motivating learning environment.

## Tracking Projects in a Digital Space 💻

To ensure transparency and accountability, we use various digital tools to track project progress and facilitate collaboration. These tools include:

- **Taiga**: For project management and task tracking.
- **Nextcloud**: For file sharing and collaboration.
- **Etherpad**: For real-time document editing and collaboration.
- **GitLab**: For version control and code collaboration.
- **Jitsi**: For virtual meetings and video conferencing.

By leveraging these tools, we create a cohesive digital workspace where all team members can stay informed, collaborate effectively, and track their progress in real-time.
