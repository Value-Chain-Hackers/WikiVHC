## What We Do at Value Chain Hackers

### Real-World Projects üåç

At Value Chain Hackers, we engage in real-world supply chain projects that address actual industry challenges. These projects provide a practical, hands-on learning experience that goes beyond theoretical knowledge. You'll work on tasks that have real impact and contribute to meaningful solutions in the supply chain sector.

### Agile-Scrum Methodology üõ†Ô∏è

We utilize the Agile-Scrum methodology to manage our projects. This approach ensures that our work is structured, iterative, and flexible, allowing us to adapt to changes quickly and efficiently. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the Scrum process:

- **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of project tasks and requirements.
- **Sprint Planning**: A collaborative meeting to select tasks for the upcoming sprint.
- **Sprint Backlog**: The list of tasks committed to be completed in the sprint.
- **Daily Scrum**: A short, daily meeting to synchronize activities and plan the next 24 hours.
- **Development Work**: The actual work done during the sprint to achieve the sprint goal.
- **Increment**: The sum of all completed backlog items during a sprint.
- **Sprint Review**: A meeting at the end of the sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the backlog.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting to reflect on the sprint process and identify improvements.

For a detailed breakdown of the Scrum process, refer to the [Scrum Process](scrum-process.qmd) page.

Our digital lab provides a flexible and accessible learning environment. With tools like Nextcloud, Etherpad, and Jitsi, you‚Äôll collaborate seamlessly with your team, regardless of location. This setup ensures that you can engage with the program while balancing other commitments.

### AI and Innovation ü§ñ

We integrate AI technologies to enhance our supply chain projects. AI helps in analyzing vast amounts of data, optimizing processes, and predicting future trends. By incorporating AI, we stay at the forefront of innovation and ensure that our solutions are cutting-edge.

### Continuous Improvement üîÑ

Continuous improvement is a core principle of our methodology. Through regular sprint retrospectives and feedback sessions, we constantly seek ways to enhance our processes and outcomes. This iterative approach ensures that we are always learning and improving.
