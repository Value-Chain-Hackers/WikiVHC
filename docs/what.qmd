## What We Do at Value Chain Hackers

### Real-World Projects 🌍

At Value Chain Hackers, we engage in real-world supply chain projects that address actual industry challenges. These projects provide a practical, hands-on learning experience that goes beyond theoretical knowledge. You'll work on tasks that have real impact and contribute to meaningful solutions in the supply chain sector.

### Agile-Scrum Methodology 🛠️

We utilize the Agile-Scrum methodology to manage our projects. This approach ensures that our work is structured, iterative, and flexible, allowing us to adapt to changes quickly and efficiently. Here’s a brief overview of the Scrum process:

- **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of project tasks and requirements.
- **Sprint Planning**: A collaborative meeting to select tasks for the upcoming sprint.
- **Sprint Backlog**: The list of tasks committed to be completed in the sprint.
- **Daily Scrum**: A short, daily meeting to synchronize activities and plan the next 24 hours.
- **Development Work**: The actual work done during the sprint to achieve the sprint goal.
- **Increment**: The sum of all completed backlog items during a sprint.
- **Sprint Review**: A meeting at the end of the sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the backlog.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting to reflect on the sprint process and identify improvements.

For a detailed breakdown of the Scrum process, refer to the [Scrum Process](scrum-process.qmd) page.
