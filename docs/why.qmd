## Why Scrum Agile Working Methodology

### Flexibility and Adaptability

Scrum provides a framework that allows teams to respond to changes efficiently, ensuring that projects stay on track even when unexpected challenges arise.

This commitment to ongoing improvement ensures that we are always striving to be better, delivering higher quality results with each iteration.

### Clear Goals and Accountability

Scrum provides clear goals and accountability. Each sprint has specific objectives, and team members know exactly what is expected of them. This clarity helps keep everyone focused and motivated, driving progress and ensuring that we meet our targets effectively.
