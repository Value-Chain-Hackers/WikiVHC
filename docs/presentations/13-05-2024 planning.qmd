#### Sprint 1: Basic Ontology Setup and Initial Data Integration

**Sprint Goal A**: 
- Establish the foundation for the Power Dynamics Ecosystem visualization.

##### Sub-Goals A:

**Define Key Supply Chain Elements**:
- [x] Identify and document primary elements like suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers.
- [x] Create a working ontology and implement it in the system.


## Demo: What Went Well

1. **Ontology Implementation**: 
    - Successfully integrated the ontology framework.
    - Enhanced the system's understanding and extensibility by replacing traditional relational database structures.
    - Enabled system to guess nodes using first-order logic and automate the search process.
3. **Feature Requests Addressed**:
    - Noted and planned important feature requests like the accuracy counter for supply chain mapping.
4. **Initial MVP**:
    - Demonstrated an initial version of a minimally viable product (MVP).

## Segmentation.
2. **AI Segmentation**:
    - Divided process into three distinct AI components:
        - AI for searching information.
        - AI for making connections and data mashing.
        - AI for creating displays, widgets, and tables.

## What Could Be Improved
1. **Accuracy and Quality Assurance**:
    - Ensure the system's accuracy and address concerns about missing small, vital components.
    - Requested a feature to improve accuracy.
2. **Focus and Scope Management**:
    - Avoid getting into "rabbit holes".
    - Focus on achieving a functional product that provides reasonably accurate mappings.
3. **Balancing Development Efforts**:
    - Balance efforts between creating a usable product and maintaining high accuracy.

## Work done
- [x] Create a protocol to allow the AI to control the UI elements and dynamically render various visualizations.
- [x] CREWS need to start working to crawl the internet for subquestions.
- [x] Finetune: protocol to allow the AI to control the UI elements and dynamically render various visualizations.
- [x] Create an ontology to describe the supply chain elements as a schema to help the AI structurize knowledge.
- [x] Chat system needs to work and update map upon prompt.

## Work done' continued
- [x] Creating a digital environment and bringing it online.
- [x] Updating the contacts sheet, making it into markdown.
- [x] Recruiting text for students
- [x] Making a website - process

## Next Sprint

### Tasks

**Next Steps:**

EPIC Visualize Power Dynamics Ecosystem: 
- Develop a feature to visualize the entire ecosystem based on a company name within 20 minutes.

### Sprint Goal

- Integrate all core components, ensure system reliability and accuracy, and prepare for a visual launch of the Power Dynamics Ecosystem feature.
- Feature request: Accuracy Counter!

## Sub-Goals

1. **Enhance Ontology Framework**:
    - Finalize the ontology for comprehensive representation of supply chain elements and relationships.

2. **Develop and Refine Visualizations**:
    - Make sure it updates the D3.js
    - Create a design visual framework. 


## Sub-Goals Continued

3. **User Feedback Integration**:
    - Schedule another demo and feedback on this. 

4. **System Testing and Quality Assurance**:
    - Conduct thorough testing to ensure accuracy and reliability.

5. **Prepare for Visual Launch**:
    - Finalize elements for a successful visual launch.
