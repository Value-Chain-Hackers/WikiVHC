    "section": "9.5 What",
    "text": "9.5 What\nBy adopting Agile-Scrum, EU-funded projects can significantly increase their success rates and efficiency. Agile methodologies are roughly twice as likely to succeed compared to traditional Waterfall projects, largely due to their adaptability and responsiveness to change. They also reduce costs and deliver projects faster by addressing issues incrementally and ensuring continuous alignment with stakeholder needs. Furthermore, continuous stakeholder involvement and collaboration foster a participatory governance model, aligning with the EU’s principles. Finally, Agile-Scrum’s focus on regular retrospectives and iterative testing ensures that projects meet the EU’s commitment to excellence and innovation, reducing the likelihood of late-stage failures and enhancing overall project quality. This comprehensive approach not only aligns with the EU’s strategic goals but also maximizes the impact and efficiency of its funding.\n\n9.5.1 1. Flexibility and Responsiveness to Change\n\n9.5.1.1 Dynamic Market Needs\n\nTraditional Approach: The Waterfall model, commonly used in traditional EU-funded projects, involves a linear and sequential development process. While it allows for thorough initial planning, it is often inflexible to changes once the project is underway. This rigidity can be detrimental in rapidly evolving sectors like social impact investing, where stakeholder needs and regulatory landscapes are continually shifting.\nAgile-Scrum: Agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, are designed to handle change. Scrum’s iterative cycles (sprints) allow the project to incorporate feedback and adapt to new requirements regularly. This continuous adaptability ensures that the final product remains relevant and valuable to stakeholders.\n\n\n\n9.5.1.2 Empirical Process Control\n\nTraditional Approach: Relies on a detailed upfront specification and planning, which assumes that all requirements are known from the start. This assumption often leads to scope creep or the need for extensive changes as new insights emerge.\nAgile-Scrum: Uses an empirical process control model, which emphasizes inspection, adaptation, and transparency. By regularly reviewing progress and making adjustments based on actual project data and stakeholder feedback, Agile-Scrum ensures that the project can pivot and refine its trajectory as needed.\n\n\n\n\n9.5.2 2. Incremental Delivery and Early Value Realization\n\n9.5.2.1 Incremental Value Delivery\n\nTraditional Approach: Often, deliverables in traditional projects are only produced towards the end of the project lifecycle. This delay can result in a longer time before stakeholders see any tangible benefits, which can be particularly problematic if initial assumptions prove incorrect.\nAgile-Scrum: Emphasizes incremental delivery of product increments at the end of each sprint. This approach not only allows stakeholders to see early and continuous value but also provides regular opportunities for feedback, ensuring the project remains aligned with stakeholder needs.\n\n\n\n9.5.2.2 Risk Mitigation\n\nTraditional Approach: Risk is often identified and managed through extensive planning phases, but unforeseen issues may not become apparent until later stages.\nAgile-Scrum: By delivering work in small, manageable increments and continuously integrating and testing components, potential risks and issues are identified and addressed early. This proactive approach significantly reduces the likelihood of critical issues arising late in the project.\n\n\n\n\n9.5.3 3. Enhanced Stakeholder Collaboration and Communication\n\n9.5.3.1 Engagement and Transparency\n\nTraditional Approach: Stakeholder engagement typically occurs at predetermined milestones, which may lead to gaps in communication and misalignment with stakeholder expectations.\nAgile-Scrum: Involves stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle through regular sprint reviews and planning meetings. This frequent interaction ensures transparency, fosters trust, and keeps stakeholders engaged and informed about the project’s progress and challenges.\n\n\n\n9.5.3.2 Collaborative Environment\n\nTraditional Approach: Often promotes siloed work environments where teams may work independently on different project phases.\nAgile-Scrum: Encourages a collaborative, cross-functional team environment. Teams work together throughout all project phases, enhancing communication, knowledge sharing, and collective ownership of the project outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n9.5.4 4. Continuous Improvement and Quality Focus\n\n9.5.4.1 Iterative Quality Assurance\n\nTraditional Approach: Quality assurance is typically a distinct phase near the end of the project, which can lead to the discovery of critical issues late in the development process.\nAgile-Scrum: Integrates continuous testing and quality assurance into each sprint. This ongoing focus on quality ensures that issues are detected and resolved promptly, leading to a more robust and reliable final product.\n\n\n\n9.5.4.2 Retrospective Culture\n\nTraditional Approach: Project evaluations and lessons learned sessions are usually conducted at the project’s conclusion, which may be too late to benefit the current project.\nAgile-Scrum: Incorporates regular sprint retrospectives, allowing the team to reflect on their processes, identify areas for improvement, and implement changes in subsequent sprints. This culture of continuous improvement enhances team performance and project outcomes over time.",

Alignment with EU’s Innovation Goals\n\n9.6.1.1 Flexibility and Responsiveness to Change\n\nEU Perspective: The European Union emphasizes innovation and adaptability in its funding programs. Agile-Scrum’s iterative cycles are particularly suited to the EU’s objectives of fostering innovative solutions and adapting to emerging trends and technologies.
